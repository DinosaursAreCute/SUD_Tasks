# SUD_Tasks: School Programming Assignments

Welcome to the **SUD_Tasks** repository! This project contains my solutions to various programming assignments given in our school courses. The code is organized by topic and demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

## Project Structure

- `Code/Employees/` — Classes and tests related to employee management (e.g., `Employee`, `Manager`, `Department`, etc.)
- `Code/Shapes/` — Classes for 2D and 3D geometric shapes and their properties
- `Code/Vehicles/` — Vehicle management classes (e.g., `Vehicle`, `Bus`, `Truck`, etc.)
- `Code/Test/` — Test classes for the main modules
- `Feature_Files/` — Assignment descriptions and supporting documents

## Java Versions
- **Version Used:** Java 17
- **Lowest Supported Version:** Java 8

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DinosaursAreCute/SUD_Tasks.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Compile the Java files. For example, from the `Code` directory:
   ```sh
   javac Employees/*.java Shapes/*.java Vehicles/*.java Test/*.java
   ```
4. Run any test class, e.g.:
   ```sh
   java Employees.TestDepartment
   ```

## FAQ
- **Q: Can I use this code for my own assignments?**

### Legend of GitHub Terms

- **Repository (Repo):** A storage space where your project resides. It contains all your project files and their history.
- **Branch:** A separate version of your code where you can make changes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your changes. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge your changes from one branch into another (usually the main branch).
- **Fork:** A copy of a repository that you can modify without affecting the original project.
- **Clone:** A local copy of a repository on your computer.
- **Merge:** Combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Stage:** Preparing changes to be included in a commit.
- **Push:** Sending your committed changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
- **Pull:** Fetching and merging changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
